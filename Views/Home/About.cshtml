<p>
    My name is Leandra Perumal and I am currently in my second year of studies at the University of Pretoria. I am 19 years old and I am studying
    Bcom Informatics. I grew up in a small town called Volksrust and in grade 9 my family and I moved to Middelburg where I completed matric in Hoerskool
    Kanonkop. I have one brother and live with my parents. I enjoy coding a lot but I prefer accounting and business management as I work very well with numbers.
    I can play the piano and I am also learning how to play the violin. Travelling is something that I really enjoy and once I graduate and get a good job I hope
